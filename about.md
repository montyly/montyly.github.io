# About SecEureka

I work as an independent security researcher.

SecEureka is the name I use for my approach to security work.

---

## Why I Do This Work

I focus on **deep security understanding** in complex systems where surface-level analysis is insufficient.

What motivates me is uncovering how systems actually behave under stress, misuse, and unexpected interactions. I’m drawn to problems that resist easy explanations and require sustained technical engagement.

#### *Why SecEureka?*

*What drove Archimedes to run naked through the streets was understanding.
That is what I chase.*

## How I Work

I work with teams operating at the edges of technology to help them understand and secure systems that are still being defined.

My work emphasizes deep technical investigation, original analysis, and direct engagement with complex architectures, particularly in blockchain and other high-risk domains.

In addition to client work, I contribute through public research, education, and shared technical work, with the goal of advancing understanding rather than producing noise.

## Principles

### Security as a Craft

Security is not a checklist or a compliance exercise. It is a craft that blends creativity, rigorous analysis, tooling, and hard-earned intuition.

I work as a hacker and a scholar, using an adversarial mindset to understand systems beyond their intended use, and careful reasoning to build well-founded conclusions.

### Depth Over Scale

I prioritize depth of understanding over growth, speed, or standardization in how I choose and approach work.

### Learning Through Hard Problems

I seek work that stretches my understanding. The most valuable problems are those that challenge assumptions and force new mental models.

### Intellectual Honesty

I avoid selective framing, incomplete facts presented as conclusions, and analysis shaped to support a predetermined narrative.

When uncertainty exists, I acknowledge it. When trade-offs exist, I make them explicit.

### Contribution to the Community

Security knowledge compounds when shared responsibly. Public research, education, and shared technical insight are integral to my work.
