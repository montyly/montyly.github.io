# About SecEureka

I work as an independent security researcher.

SecEureka is the name I use for my approach to security work.

## Why I Do This Work

I focus on complex systems where surface-level analysis is not enough.

What motivates me is uncovering how systems actually behave under stress, misuse, and unexpected interactions. I’m drawn to problems that resist easy explanations and require sustained technical engagement.

## Principles

### Security as a Craft

Security is not a checklist or a compliance exercise. It requires creativity, rigorous analysis, and understanding systems beyond their intended use.

My work sits somewhere between an adversarial mindset and careful research. Part hacker, part scholar. I try to break things while building conclusions that hold up to scrutiny.

### Depth over Scale

I prioritize depth of understanding over growth and speed in how I choose and approach work. I favor fewer engagements over a full calendar of surface-level reviews.

### Learning through Hard Problems

I seek work that stretches my understanding. Blockchain security evolves constantly, and I try to evolve with it. I look for work that challenges me rather than lets me coast on what I already know.

### Intellectual Honesty

I avoid selective framing, incomplete facts presented as conclusions, and analysis shaped to support a predetermined narrative.

When uncertainty exists, I acknowledge it. When trade-offs exist, I make them explicit.

### Contribution to the Community

Security knowledge compounds when shared. I publish research, tools, write about techniques, and try to contribute back to the community where I can.
